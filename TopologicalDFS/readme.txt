Implementation of Data Structures and Algorithms. 
SP8: Implementing Topological Order using DFS. 

Team Members:
Shivani Mankotia(sxm180018)
Akshay Kanduri (axk175430)

Prerequisites:
Eclipse Java 
Java(JDK) 8

Create a java project and create 3 java classes in it under packages sxm180018 and rbk as follows: 
- package sxm180018
	- DFS.java
- package rbk
	- Graph.java
	- Timer.java
Copy the codes from sxm180018>src folder into respective files above and execute DFS.java. 

Input: 
Sample Input is already given as: String string = "3 2    1 2 1    1 3 1"; 
The above graph contains no cycles, hence the output will be topological order. 

Another sample input is given which is commented: //String string = "7 10  1 1 4  1 4 2   1 2 3   2 3 5   3 7 4   4 2 1   4 5 7   6 5 1   6 7 1  6 3 2";
The above graph is contains self loop at node 1, hence the output will be null.
